            <h2>Gising Na Pilipinas</h2>
            <p><strong>By Anonymous | August 12, 2019</strong></p>
            <p>“Wake up Philippines!”</p>
            
            <p>That’s what foreigners say—urging us to wake up, to see the injustices, to recognize the corruption, to acknowledge the crimes committed by those in power. But what about us, the people of the Philippines? What do we have to say? This is a story from a local’s perspective.</p>
            
            <p>I wasn’t born in the Philippines, but I have lived here my entire life. This is my home. I am a citizen. I was 10 when Rodrigo Duterte was proclaimed president on May 30, 2016. The adults around me who supported him dismissed my thoughts, telling me I was too young to have an opinion. But I do have one.</p>
            
            <p>People say I have been influenced by the West, that I don’t understand my own country. But I do. I have studied our bayanis, read our famous literature, learned about our diverse tribes and cultures before Spanish colonization, and taught myself the Filipino language. I have earned the right to voice my thoughts on our government. And what do I see? Corruption. It has always been corrupt. From the moment Emilio Aguinaldo sold our country to the Americans, we have been drowned by leaders who put their own interests above the people.</p>
            
            <p>History repeats itself. We overthrew a dictator in 1986, only to see the same cycle of corruption persist. We cried out against extrajudicial killings, yet we allowed a man who bragged about them to lead us. We fought for democracy, yet we surrender it time and time again for the illusion of order.</p>
            
            <p>We are a nation that has suffered, endured, and survived. But when will we thrive? When will we refuse to be silenced? When will we finally wake up?</p>
            
            <p>To those who still believe that the system works for the people—look again. Look at the families who have lost loved ones to the drug war, their cries ignored. Look at the journalists silenced for telling the truth. Look at the poverty-stricken communities that remain unseen by those in power. Look at our history and ask yourself: how much longer will we allow this cycle to continue?</p>
            
            <p>Gising na, Pilipinas. Our country deserves better. And it starts with us.</p>
